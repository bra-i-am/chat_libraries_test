## Libraries

### [React Chat UI: MinChat](https://github.com/MinChatHQ/react-chat-ui)

[Example of use](src/chat_components/ChatUI.tsx)

#### Personal Score: 7/10

- Ease of Use: 8/10 (Easy implementation due to TypeScript usage)
- Customization: 7/10 (Customizable through a [JS object and color codes](https://github.com/MinChatHQ/react-chat-ui?tab=readme-ov-file#modify-component-colors), but limited options)
- Documentation: 6/10 (Not as good as desired, but has some [Storybook components](https://github.com/MinChatHQ/react-chat-ui/tree/master/stories))

#### Additional Notes:

The documentation is lacking, but the Storybook components provide some guidance. According to npm trends, MinChat has a relatively low number of weekly downloads (292) [NPM Comparison][1]. The library's GitHub page shows a small community with 4 contributors, 7 successful PRs and 5 open issues.

### [Chat UI Kit: ChatScope](https://github.com/chatscope/chat-ui-kit-react)

[Example of use](src/chat_components/ChatScope.tsx)

#### Personal Score: 9.5/10

- Ease of Use: 8.5/10 (More complex implementation, but more extensible due to independent components)
- Customization: 9/10 (Customizable through [SCSS variable overrides](https://github.com/chatscope/chat-ui-kit-styles/issues/5), offering a high degree of customization)
- Documentation: 9.5/10 (Fully created in [Storybook](https://chatscope.io/storybook/react/?path=/docs/documentation-introduction--docs), complete, and well-maintained)

#### Additional Notes:

The library has a steeper learning curve due to its complex implementation, but offers a high degree of customization and extensibility. The documentation is excellent, providing a comprehensive guide to the library's features and usage. According to npm trends, ChatScope has a much higher number of weekly downloads (14,569) [NPM Comparison][1]. The library's GitHub page shows a larger and more active community with 5 contributors, 10 successful PRs and 49 open issues.

### [React Chat Elements](https://github.com/Detaysoft/react-chat-elements)

[Example of use](src/chat_components/ChatElements.tsx)

#### Personal Score: 9/10

- Ease of Use: 8/10 (More complex implementation, but more extensible due to independent components)
- Customization: 8/10 (No explicit theming option, but can be added custom classNames to some components)
- Documentation: 8.5/10 ([Complete enough](https://detaysoft.github.io/docs-react-chat-elements/docs/intro/), but could be improved)

##### Additional Notes:

The library has a similar complexity to ChatScope, but with a slightly lower degree of customization. The documentation is good, but could benefit from more examples and guidance on customization. According to npm trends, React Chat Elements has a moderate number of weekly downloads (8,975) [NPM Comparison][1].
